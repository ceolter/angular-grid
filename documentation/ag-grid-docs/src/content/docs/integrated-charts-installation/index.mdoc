This section shows how to install Integrated Charts using Modules or Packages.

## Integrated Charts Module

To reduce bundle sizes in applications that do not require charts, AG Grid provides a dedicated charts [AG Grid Module](./modules/),
free from third-party library dependencies. This approach is recommended for most applications.

The Integrated Enterprise Charts module, which includes AG Charts Enterprise, can be imported as follows:

```ts
// Import minimal modules required for charts
import { ModuleRegistry } from "@ag-grid-community/core";
import { ClientSideRowModelModule } from "@ag-grid-community/client-side-row-model";
import { GridChartsModule } from "@ag-grid-enterprise/charts-enterprise";

ModuleRegistry.registerModules([CommunityFeaturesModule, ClientSideRowModelModule, GridChartsModule]);
```

{% note %}
When importing from `@ag-grid-enterprise/charts`, only AG Chart Community features are available.
{% /note %}

## Integrated Charts Package

Applications that are not using ES6 Modules and are instead using the bundled version of AG Grid Enterprise
can install Integrated Enterprise Charts as follows:

```bash
npm install --save ag-grid-charts-enterprise
```

Then in your code you can import the charts module as shown below:

```ts
// import the AG Grid Enteprise package - this includes all enterprise features and performs all 
// required registration
import  "ag-grid-charts-enterprise";

// rest of your code 
```

The `ag-grid-charts-enterprise` package includes AG Grid Enterprise and AG Charts Enterprise.

{% note %}
The `ag-grid-enterprise` package is limited to AG Chart Community features.
